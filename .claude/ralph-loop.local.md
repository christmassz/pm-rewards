Read docs/AGENT.md, docs/PRD.md, docs/PROGRESS.md. Follow docs/AGENT.md exactly. Do the next incomplete T# from docs/PRD.md (one task only). Run the task’s verification commands. Append required logs. Append a new entry to docs/PROGRESS.md. If verified complete, git add -A, git diff --staged, git commit -m 'T# <short>', and git push if allowed. Stop after finishing that single T#.
